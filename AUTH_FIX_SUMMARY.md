# Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem
"User not found with this token" error occurring when trying to complete onboarding and access dashboard endpoints.

## Root Causes

1. **Mock User Data Incomplete**
   - Mock users in `mockAuthService.ts` were missing required fields:
     - `onboardingCompleted`
     - `audioTranscriptions` and `imageGenerations` in usage
     - `notifications` object in preferences
     - `region` in location
     - `startDate` in subscription

2. **Dashboard Controllers Not Mock-Aware**
   - `dashboardController.ts` was only using `User.findById()` which doesn't work in mock mode
   - All dashboard endpoints failed when MongoDB wasn't connected

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated Mock User Data (`mockAuthService.ts`)

**Added missing fields to mock users:**
```typescript
{
  onboardingCompleted: false,
  location: {
    country: 'Ghana',
    city: 'Accra',
    region: 'Greater Accra'  // Added
  },
  preferences: {
    theme: 'light',
    language: 'en',
    notifications: {  // Added
      email: true,
      push: true,
      sms: false
    }
  },
  subscription: {
    plan: 'starter',
    status: 'active',
    startDate: new Date(),  // Added
    usage: {
      contentGenerations: 5,
      audioTranscriptions: 0,  // Added
      imageGenerations: 0,     // Added
      apiCalls: 10
    }
  }
}
```

**Updated `createUser()` function:**
- Now includes all required fields for new users
- Properly merges user data with defaults
- Sets `onboardingCompleted: false` by default

### 2. Made Dashboard Controllers Mock-Aware (`dashboardController.ts`)

**Added mock mode detection:**
```typescript
import { MockAuthService } from '../services/mockAuthService'
import mongoose from 'mongoose'

const isMockMode = (): boolean => {
  return mongoose.connection.readyState === 0 || process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
}
```

**Updated all controller functions:**
- `getDashboardStats()` - Now checks mock mode before fetching user
- `getUserActivity()` - Now checks mock mode before fetching user
- `getUsageAnalytics()` - Now checks mock mode before fetching user
- `completeOnboarding()` - Now uses `MockAuthService.updateUser()` in mock mode

**Example pattern used:**
```typescript
const userId = req.user._id.toString()
let user: any

if (isMockMode()) {
  user = await MockAuthService.findUserById(userId)
} else {
  user = await User.findById(userId)
}
```

## Testing the Fix

### Test Onboarding Completion
1. Login with mock user: `john@example.com` / `password`
2. Complete onboarding flow
3. Should successfully update user and redirect to dashboard

### Test Dashboard Endpoints
```bash
# Login first to get token
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"john@example.com","password":"password"}' \
  -c cookies.txt

# Test dashboard stats
curl http://localhost:3001/api/dashboard/stats -b cookies.txt

# Test activity
curl http://localhost:3001/api/dashboard/activity -b cookies.txt

# Test analytics
curl http://localhost:3001/api/dashboard/analytics -b cookies.txt

# Test onboarding completion
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/onboarding \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -b cookies.txt \
  -d '{
    "purpose": ["content_creation"],
    "preferredLanguages": ["en", "tw"],
    "goals": ["increase_engagement"]
  }'
```

## Mock Users Available

### User 1 (Needs Onboarding)
- **Email:** john@example.com
- **Password:** password
- **Plan:** starter
- **Onboarding:** Not completed

### User 2 (Already Onboarded)
- **Email:** jane@example.com
- **Password:** password
- **Plan:** professional
- **Onboarding:** Completed

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Development Mode Works** - No MongoDB required for testing
2. ✅ **Onboarding Completes** - Users can now complete onboarding successfully
3. ✅ **Dashboard Loads** - All dashboard endpoints work in mock mode
4. ✅ **Consistent Data** - Mock users have all required fields
5. ✅ **Easy Testing** - Can test with predefined mock users

## Production Considerations

- Mock mode automatically disabled when MongoDB is connected
- All real database operations remain unchanged
- Mock mode only activates when:
  - `mongoose.connection.readyState === 0` (not connected)
  - OR `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'`

## Next Steps

1. Test the complete user flow from registration to dashboard
2. Verify all dashboard features work correctly
3. Test with real MongoDB connection to ensure production code works
4. Add more mock users if needed for testing different scenarios
