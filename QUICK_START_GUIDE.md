## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Onboarding doesn't show
**Solution:** Check that `onboardingCompleted` is `false` in the user document

### Issue: Dashboard stats show 0
**Solution:** Generate some content in AI Generator first, or check backend connection

### Issue: Dark mode doesn't persist
**Solution:** Clear browser cache and cookies, then try again

### Issue: Navigation doesn't work
**Solution:** Ensure Next.js dev server is running and check console for errors

### Issue: API calls fail
**Solution:** 
1. Check backend is running on port 3001
2. Verify CORS settings allow localhost:3000
3. Check browser console for specific errors
