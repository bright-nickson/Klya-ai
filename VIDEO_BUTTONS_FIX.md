## 🎬 How It Works Now

### User Flow:

## 📝 Notes

### CSS Warnings
The Tailwind CSS warnings (`@tailwind`, `@apply`) are **expected and safe to ignore**. These are Tailwind directives that work correctly at runtime. They only show as warnings in the IDE because the CSS language server doesn't recognize Tailwind syntax.

### Video Selection
Currently using educational AI videos from YouTube as placeholders. You can replace these with your own custom demo videos by:

1. Recording screen demos of your actual features
2. Uploading to YouTube
3. Updating the `videoUrl` in each demo object
4. Or use direct MP4 files instead of YouTube embeds

### Future Improvements
- Add custom demo videos showing actual KLYA AI features
- Add video thumbnails for better preview
- Add video progress tracking
- Add analytics to track which demos are watched most
- Add closed captions for accessibility
